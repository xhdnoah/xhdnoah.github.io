My name is Noah. I was an Electronic Engineering Student at 湖南大学. During School I studied C language with basic data structures and algorithms, in addition to participating in some computer hardware related courses. As for extra-curricular activities, I joined the designed and photography clubs, and I was an editor of 湖大青年. After graduation, I became a programmer after graduation.

My interests span programming languages, web development and classic algorithms. I have no formal training in computer science, but I have continued to keep learning on my own. Recently I am reading Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, which is really a masterpiece. Working on React introduces me the new world of functional programming. I enjoy researching features of various programming languages, thinking about benefits and the tradeoff behind them. I am interested in web development because the openness of the web, as well as the open source community, appeals to me. I use Vim to write almost everything, which saved my carpal tunnel syndrome.
